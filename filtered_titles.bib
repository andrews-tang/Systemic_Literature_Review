 abstract = {Many food contamination incidents have occurred during the last decade which has proven the failure of the food supply chain management system to track the food, money, and information movement within the food supply chain. Many models have been established. This paper presents the design and implementation of the new model providing real-time data acquisition, monitoring, and storing on a tamper-proof blockchain of the main food supply movement. This system is using smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to allow every participant to transact securely with other FSC players. IoT networks are implemented in different workplaces to gather multiple data about food status without human involvement to ensure transparency by different sensors. Machine learning models are established to ensure the correctness of the collected data and help drive decision making within the application or businesses. © 2023 Lviv Polytechnic National University.},

@article{adow_analysis_2022,
 abstract = {By 2050, the world's population will have increased by 34\%, to more than 9 billion people, needing a 70\% increase in food production. Prepare more dishes with fewer ingredients. Therefore, the critical goal of manufacturers is to increase production while being ecologically benign. Supply chain systems that do not enable direct farmer-to-consumer connection and rising input costs influence data collection, security, and sharing. Constraints on data security, manipulation, and single-point failure are unfulfilled due to a lack of centralized IoT agricultural infrastructure. To address these issues, the article proposes a blockchain-based IoT model. This study also shows one-of-a-kind energy savings. The decentralization of data storage improves the supply chain's transparency and quality through blockchain technology, thus farmers can engage more efficiently. Blockchain technology improves supply chain traceability and security. This article provides a transparent, decentralized blockchain tracking solution and proposes an intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor crop development and the agricultural environment. A new approach has resolved the bulk of the supply chain difficulties. Smart contracts were utilized to organize all transactions in decentralized supply networks. The use of blockchain technology improves transaction quality, and customers may verify the legitimacy of an item's authenticity and legality by using the system. A total of 100 IoT nodes were distributed randomly to each 500 m2 cluster farm. The Internet of Things nodes were used to assess soil moisture, temperature, and crop disease. Network stability period and network life of the proposed method show 90.4\% accuracy. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. The immutability of ledger technology and smart contract support further increases supply chain security, privacy, transparency, and trust among all stakeholders in the multi-party system. By 2050, the world's population will need a 70\% increase in food production. The food supply chain will be more efficient and trustworthy with an intelligent model. This article provides a transparent, decentralized, and intelligent model protocol for several Internet of Things (IoT) devices. © 2022 Anass Hamadelneel Adow et al.},

@article{ashraf_prototype_2023,
 abstract = {The main objective of this article is to present a prototype that integrates blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to digitize information across a generic Supply Chain (SC). Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.},

@article{assaqty_private-blockchain-based_2020,
 abstract = {Automation in smart manufacturing depends on many parties in the supply chain and distribution networks. A smart manufacturer needs to track the location and state of materials from its suppliers and products to its customers/distributors to manage the corresponding production schedule. The need for such information can be fulfilled by the use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices installed at each respective party. However, even though all parties may trust one another, they have confidential data produced by the IIoT devices that are not allowed to be shared with other parties, or only allowed to be exchanged with certain parties. Even though the data are not confidential, they may still be required to share partial data based on the needs of each party. On the other hand, all parties have their independent systems that differ from each other, which leads to complex integration. Regarding those situations, a private-blockchain-based IIoT is promising to bridge the need for product and material tracking information exchange between parties while maintaining the respective confidentiality.},

@inproceedings{b_blockchain_2022,
 abstract = {In this work, we show how blockchain can be used to manage the supply chain for non-perishable agricultural food (NPAF). Keeping product quality high across the supply chain is a major challenge for the food business. Traditional foods are severely affected. The system's major purpose is to make product history accessible. At each stage of the supply chain, the product can be checked for quality and cleanliness. We created a trust less environment by utilising Blockchain, RFID, and IoT. Encryption and the network are more trusted than public or private institutions. This research suggests an execution model for the supply chain management of non-perishable agricultural foods that addresses these challenges by combining Ethereum smart contracts with IPFS, RFID, and IoT technologies. These technologies were combined in an effort to find a solution to these problems. The technology will give consumers a clear view of the complete process from raw material to the finished product and make it simple for a controlling authority to conduct operational examinations on the excellence of the goods and decent working practises.},

@article{bhat_agriculture-food_2022,
 abstract = {Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {Blockchains play a vital role in FARMAR to track and trace the origin of food products in food supply chain. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is an essential business process in all spheres of the economy. SCM uses specific processes to connect from producer to consumer requirement through a chain. In a BCT(Blockchain Technology) based system, “records are immutable and trusted, eliminating the need for third parties to be involved. Potential farmer-facing impacts include ensuring that farmers receive timely and complete payments through the use of smart contracts and helping farmers to capture real-time data to more effectively manage their crops and harvests (source: nextbillion.net)”. Another benefit of using BCT in FARMAR is security where hacking or tampering the existing data is impossible by any intermediary. As an add-on to this process, IoT devices (Mobile phone-based Android app) are used to update the real-time quality and transit time of the product in FARMAR. It is integrated for improved traceability and usability of the products in the supply chain. The FARMAR aims to achieve these goals by developing a web application where FARMAR creates a value chain of integrity from farm to fork by using BCT. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

How to ensure information security and achieve efficient product traceability is an urgent problem to be solved in the development of the steel IoT platform. In view of the low transparency of information traceability of current steel products and the defects of information islands, in this article the blockchain-based steel IoT quality traceability system is developed and adopted the alliance chain mode and the Hyperledger blockchain platform. Experimental tests prove that production companies, logistics, and consumers can participate in the information certification of steel products via the system. Consumers can understand the real product manufacturing process, effectively avoiding the incomplete information and low transparency in the traditional information traceability process, and effectively trace the quality of steel products. The system provides an effective scheme for promoting the transformation and upgrading of the steel industry.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of agricultural informatization, Agricultural Internet of Things has gradually become a necessary infrastructure for smart agriculture. In the future, smart agriculture depends on a large number of IoT sensors. In order to solve the problems of isolated, unreliable, easily tampered and difficult to track responsibility in the Agricultural Internet of Things, this paper proposes a trusted traceability system of Agricultural Internet of Things based on blockchain. Considering the characteristics of large amount and wide variety of Agricultural Internet of Things data, this scheme is based on the hyperledger fabric intelligent contract, adopts the distributed raft consensus protocol, combined with Internet of Things equipment services and accurate authority control, it realizes the reliable traceability of Internet of Things data storage, redundant data filtering and attribute based access control, greatly reduces redundant data and improves security. In the scheme provided in this paper, the farm administrator authorizes the employee user to bind the Internet of things device. The text data uploaded by the Internet of things device regularly is sent to the smart contract for clustering and screening. After removing the redundant data, it is linked and stored. IPFS is used to store images and videos, the content hash and smart contract are stored in the blockchain to manage its life cycle. A large number of local data are analyzed, counted and visually displayed in the mode of on chain storage and off chain calculation. For the text data, the method of direct uplink storage is adopted, and the picture files are stored locally and verified in the chain to ensure that the picture information is not tampered with. The simulation and analysis results show that this scheme is superior to the traditional traceability in terms of stability and security, and its performance meets the requirements of thousands of IoT devices on the chain concurrently. © 2022, China Science Publishing \& Media LTD.

@article{choudhury_blockchain-iot_2022,
 abstract = {India is yet to meet 100\% blood unit requirements from blood donations across the country. On top of that there is a huge wastage of blood due to lack of a proper monitoring system. There are also many instances of loss of lives, infection of HIV and other severe diseases due to transfusion of unfit blood. So in this work we have designed a Blockchain based Blood Supply Chain Management System to address these critical issues associated with blood donation. The system supports all stakeholders involved with the traditional blood donation process namely Donor, Inspection Center, Hospitals, Blood Banks and Blood Donation Registry. In addition to the inherent advantages of Blockchain like immutability, availability, transparency, security, auditability, the system is designed to provide authentication, attribute based access control and authorisation, multi party endorsements, IoT based automated data insertion directly into the ledger and source tracking of blood. The main aim of the proposed system is to bring the much needed transparency and accountability into the blood donation framework, and with the features mentioned the system has the capability to radically change the blood donation scenario in India. The proposed system is implemented using Hyperledger Fabric, a private Blockchain which allows only restricted access to the system by the stakeholders. Every event is recorded as a transaction in the ledger by the miners. Smart contracts are used to enforce business logic and necessary constraints in the system. We did comparative analysis of the system against other similar available systems and also evaluated the performance based on throughput and latency. Results showed that the system performance is up to the mark. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

 abstract = {Most of supply chain networks have encountered difficulties when trying to integrate all components and stakeholders (customers, warehouse, transportation, and raw material production), which make supply chain management system suffering from a lack of efficiency and transparency that make a steady increase in good's falsification and consumer's disappointment. All information about good's production, storage and transportation should flow clearly during all stages of the supply chain by tracking and authenticating to avoid product's contamination or fraud in the network. Current tracking IoT-based systems are built on top of centralized architecture and this leaves a gap for tampering and false information especially in urban area, but also the exsiting solutions cannot allow the information to be shared with authority or consumers. To effectively assess and assure traceability and transparency this paper proposes an approach using a distributed ledger (blockchain) besides a configuable IoT-based system to take into account all needed data including specific case of urban area, with an open data platform at the disposal of stockholders, authority and consumers. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, in traditional traceability systems, a number of stages involved and each of them provides their own data accumulated in the database. Therefore, complex traceability data are compose of too many stages easily result in confusing information for customers. Besides, centralized data storage makes data vulnerable to be tampered with. To solve these problems, hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) principles have been utilized in our work which is a comprehensive traceability system. In this work, we analyze the pigeon food production industry through HACCP principles and determine some critical control points (CCPs), including incubation, breeding, transportation, slaughtering, processing, and logistics. With the help of these CCPs, we are able to build a traceability system with critical and abundant data but not too complicated for users. To further improve the system, there are different kinds of techniques integrated into it. Firstly, a permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is selected as blockchain module to enhance trustworthiness of data. Secondly, the system contains various IoT devices for automatically collecting environmental parameter data with the aim of reducing human interference. Besides, it is worth mentioning that the proposed information management device can decrease the data entry burden. Consequently, the implementation of the traceability system increase consumers’ confidence in pigeon food production. To summarize, it is a new application of modern agricultural information technique in food safety and a bold experiment in the field of poultry, particularly pigeons. © 2022, The Author(s).},

@article{faridi_blockchain_2021,
 abstract = {Growth towards Industry 4.0 has a significant impact on the textile manufacturing industry. In this emerging technology the business and engineering processes are interconnected. The product traceability system is playing a vital role in each sector. Unfortunately, the traditional systems in textile manufacturing industries faced a lot of challenges due to in-house process and supply chain complexity. These systems do not provide a means for reliable and rapid response to backtrack data throughout the textile process of the product. Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) based processes have the capacity to overcome these challenges while deploying over the traditional product traceability system. The blockchain and IoT based system provides many benefits such as communication between product process flow to improve the performance and reduce risk, improve quality, continuous involvement of worker, product fault traceability, increase supply chain visibility, and customer’s reliability and trust-ability. In this paper, we proposed Blockchain and IoT based product traceability system. This system facilitates all stakeholders like Raw Material Suppliers, Yarn Manufacturers, Customers, and Consumers to track, monitor, and quality of the product and efficient tracking of the supply chain. This proposed solution will help textile manufacturers to improve the efficiency and quality of each product. The customer’s reliability and trust-ability will boost the manufacturer due to automated data insertion through the IoT technology, decentralized, immutable, auditable, and fault tolerance blockchain technology and traceability features. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

@article{ferrandez-pastor_agricultural_2022,
 abstract = {Facilities based on the Internet of Things and embedded systems along with the application of ambient intelligence paradigms offer new scenarios for optimization services in agronomic processes, specifically in the hemp industry. The traceability of products and activities demonstrates the scope of these technologies. However, the technologies themselves introduce integration-related problems that can affect the planned benefits. This article proposes a model that balances agricultural expert knowledge (user-centered design), value chain planning (through blockchain implementation), and digital technology (Internet of Things protocols) for providing tamper proof, transparent, and secure traceability in this agricultural sector. The proposed approach is backed by a proof-of-concept implementation in a realist scenario, using embedded devices and a permissioned blockchain. The model and its deployment fully integrate a set of services that other proposals only partially integrate. On one hand, the design creates a permissioned blockchain that contemplates the different actors in the value chain, and on the other hand, it develops services that use applications with human–machine interfaces. Finally, it deploys a network of embedded devices with Internet of Things protocols and control algorithms with automated access to the blockchain for traceability services. Combining digital systems with interoperable human tasks it has been possible to deploy a model that provides a new approach for the development of value-added services.},

@article{george_fusion_2022,
 abstract = {In today's globalized world, there is no transparency in exchanging data and information between producers and consumers. However, these tasks experience many challenges, such as administrative barriers, confidential data leakage, and extensive time delays. To overcome these challenges, we propose a decentralized, secured, and verified smart chain framework using Ethereum Smart Contract which employs Inter Planetary File Systems (IPFS) and MongoDB as storage systems to automate the process and exchange information into blocks using the Tendermint algorithm. The proposed work promotes complete traceability of the product, ensures data integrity and transparency in addition to providing security to their personal information using the Lelantos mode of shipping. The Tendermint algorithm helps to speed up the process of validating and authenticating the transaction quickly. More so in this time of pandemic, it is easier to meet the needs of customers through the Ethermint Smart Chain, which increases customer satisfaction, thus boosting their confidence. Moreover, Smart contracts help to exploit more international transaction services and provide an instant block time finality of around 5 sec using Ethermint. The paper concludes with a description of product storage and distribution adopting the Ethermint technique. The proposed system was executed based on the Ethereum-Tendermint Smart chain. Experiments were conducted on variable block sizes and the number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system seems to perform better than existing blockchain-based systems. Two configuration files were used, the first one was to describe the storage part, including its topology. The second one was a modified file to include the test rounds that Caliper should execute, including the running time and the workload content. Our findings indicate this is a promising technology for food supply chain storage and distribution. Copyright © 2022 KSII.},

@article{goyal_analysis_2023,
 abstract = {The Block chain is a peer to peer, distributed ledger in which members must establish consensus to record every new input and transactions that are stored by all members. Over the last decade, block chain technology has grown in popularity, attracting interest from a wide range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, energy, and government sectors, health, and agriculture supply chains, land registrations, and digital identifications (IDs). Block chain facilitates better opportunities and benefits in agriculture, as well as building trust between farmers and consumers and allowing the creation of reliable food supply chains. The Chapter discusses how block chain and smart contracts can improve productivity, transparency, and traceability in agricultural insurance, smart farming, and agricultural food supply chain transactions (AFSC). By applying Block chain agri-food supply chain tracking was made easy and won the trust from different stakeholders, which was a real benefit to the real heroes of the country. The consumer can research the history of a product they are thinking about buying and consume food in their cart, learning about the entire process from planting to harvesting, transporting, and selling. Food fraud may be reduced by using the traceability and integrity of financial information to detect untrustworthy intermediaries and business practices that exploit both independent farmers and cooperatives. The agricultural industry will be transformed by block chain for supply chain management. All phases of the agriculture supply chain are being simplified, enhancing food safety and preventing the sale of counterfeit goods. Access to agricultural finance services for farmers and companies could also be facilitated by the technology. This Paper presents a review and research challenges on the existing block chain based IoT applications in the agriculture domain where maximum research focuses on food supply chain and its security of Internet of things with Block chain. The chapter presents how block chain and smart contracts can increase productivity, transparency and traceability could be very effective in Agricultural insurance, smart farming, transactions of agricultural food supply chains. © 2023 Authors.

@article{grecuccio_combining_2020,
 abstract = {Recently, the interest around the Blockchain concept has grown faster and, as a consequence, several studies about the possibility of exploiting such technology in different application domains have been conducted. Most of these studies highlighted the benefits that the use of the blockchain could bring in those contexts where integrity and authenticity of the data are important, e.g., for reasons linked to regulations about consumers healthcare. In such cases, it would be important to collect data, coming in real-Time through sensors, and then store them in the blockchain, so that they can become immutable and tamper-proof. In this paper, the design and development of a software framework that allows Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to interact directly with an Ethereum-based blockchain are reported. The proposed solution represents an alternative way for integrating a wide category of IoT devices without relying on a centralized intermediary and third-party services. The main application scenario for which the project has been conceived regards food-chain traceability in the Industry 4.0 domain. Indeed, the designed system has been integrated into the depiction of a use case for monitoring the temperature of fish products within a warehouse and during the delivery process. © 2020 MDPI AG.

@article{guo_blockchain_2022,
 abstract = {Supply Chain Finance (SCF) refers to the financial service in which banks rely on core enterprises to manage the capital flow and logistics of upstream and downstream enterprises. SCF adopts a self-testing and closed-loop credit model to control funds and risks. The key factor in a successful SCF service is the deployment of SCF business-oriented information systems that allow businesses to form partnerships efficiently and expedite cash flows throughout the supply chain. Blockchain Technology (BCT), featuring decentralization, tamper-proofing, traceability, which is usually paired with the Internet of Things (IoT) in real-world contexts, has been widely adopted in the field of finance and is perfectly positioned to facilitate innovative collaborations among participants in supply chain networks. In this paper, we propose a BCT and IoT-based information management framework (named BC4Regu), which works as the regulatory to improve the information transparency in the business process of SCF. With BC4Regu, the operation cost of the whole supply chain can be significantly reduced through the coordination and integration of capital flow, information flow, logistics and trade flow in the supply chain. The contributions in this paper include: (1) proposing a novel information management framework which leverages Blockchain and IoT to solve the problem of information asymmetry in the trade of SCF; (2) proposing the technical design of BC4Regu, including the Blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledger-based integrated data flow service, and reshaped SCF process; and (3) applying BC4Regu to a group of scenarios and conducting theoretical analysis by introducing the principal-agent model to validate the BC4Regu. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

@article{hrouga_potentials_2022,
 abstract = {Asbestos has been considered as a hazardous waste in France since 1997 and it is neither recyclable nor recoverable. Hence, its storage and processing have a major impact on both human health and environment. In addition, its treatment is subject to very strict environmental regulations. Hence, to minimize the environmental regulations impact, the treatment of asbestos requires tools and new information technology (IT) enabling real-time information sharing with all reverse supply chain (RSC) actors. A successful integration of new IT such as Blockchain technology and Internet of Things (IoT) can lead to several advantages in order to help asbestos waste management. This study aims at integrating and combining Blockchain and IoT to digitize RSC for asbestos waste treatment. First, we investigate the roles and impacts of Blockchain and IoT on forward and reverse supply chain performances. Second, we propose two new conceptual models for both open and close loop digital RSC. Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of integration and combination of these digital technologies, we propose a case study for asbestos waste management. The results show that the combination of Blockchain and IoT can be implemented to provide robust digital RSC.},

Traceability is a key tool for ensuring the quality and safety of agricultural products and resolving the market-consumer confidence dilemma. The traditional traceability system has disadvantages such as opaque information, easy data tampering, poor security, and relatively closed. With its unique advantages, blockchain technology provides new solutions for reliable traceability in the agricultural product supply chain. This paper presents a strategy based on blockchain and semantic segmentation in order to provide ideas and approaches for addressing the issues of poor credibility and difficult data storage that traditional traceability systems confront.},

@inproceedings{islam_transparency-privacy_2021,
 abstract = {The integration of blockchain and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) results in a new model of supply chain in which blockchain provides common platform to record the data whereas IIoT facilitates connectivity of the devices. The temper-proof record, traceability, and verification of each step (transparency) from manufacturing to final availability of the product is made possible through blockchain which results in a transparent supply chain. However, the high-level transparency also increases the risk of disclosure of business-related and personal information (minimum privacy) such as business secrets, intellectual property, and special incentives to adversaries. Consequently, a trade-off between transparency and privacy is established. Therefore, this work proposes a blockchain-based supply chain management in the context of IIoT known as SM-IIoT which discusses this transparency-privacy trade-off. Furthermore, the trade-off problem is turned into a Game in which the participants act as players whereas the transparency and privacy leakage are the payoff and loss, respectively. Consequently, the players compete to maximize their payoffs but minimize their individual losses due to privacy leakage. Nash equilibrium gives the solution for the Game which optimizes the payoffs of the players (e.g., maximum transparency and minimum privacy leakage). The scenario is implemented through Hyperledger fabric (HF) blockchain. Moreover, the results suggested that the proposed SM-IIoT outperforms the game theory based privacy preserving analysis approach in big data (GB-PPABD) in terms of transparency. Furthermore, the comparison with other similar works revealed that SM-IIoT owns the key attributes of the supply chain including transparency-privacy trade-off, fairness, and competitive behavior modeling of the participants.},

 abstract = {The fish industry experiences substantial illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activities within traditional supply chain systems. Blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to transform the fish supply chain (SC) by incorporating distributed ledger technology (DLT) to build trustworthy, transparent, decentralized traceability systems that promote secure data sharing and employ IUU prevention and detection methods. We have reviewed current research efforts directed toward incorporating Blockchain in fish SC systems. We have discussed traceability in both traditional and smart SC systems that make use of Blockchain and IoT technologies. We demonstrated the key design considerations in terms of traceability in addition to a quality model to consider when designing smart Blockchain-based SC systems. In addition, we proposed an Intelligent Blockchain IoT-enabled fish SC framework that uses DLT for the trackability and traceability of fish products throughout harvesting, processing, packaging, shipping, and distribution to final delivery. More precisely, the proposed framework should be able to provide valuable and timely information that can be used to track and trace the fish product and verify its authenticity throughout the chain. Unlike other work, we have investigated the benefits of integrating machine learning (ML) into Blockchain IoT-enabled SC systems, focusing the discussion on the role of ML in fish quality, freshness assessment and fraud detection. © 2023 by the authors.},

The supply chain process is complex as it involves several organisations across geographical boundaries. It involves various stakeholders with multivariant processes such as product information, manufacturers, logistics, consumers, product safety, etc. These are some centralised system's challenges. Blockchain technology can achieve transparency, decentralisation, and distributed trust to resolve these issues and improve the existing system. With the help of technology, managing goods, services, and information with an efficient system can be designed to achieve high performance. The health sector is a challenge for each country in this situation of pandemic Covid-19, and to perform the smooth operation, there is a need for an end-to-end tracking system, robust, secure, and strong framework. It is required to ensure the security and integrity of data with transparency in supply chain management. This study presented the conceptual framework of blockchain enabling supply chain management to provide the solution in the healthcare industry.

A literature survey comprising an analytical review of blockchain technology with the Internet of things (IoT) for food supply chain management (FSCM) is presented to better understand the associated research benefits, issues, and challenges. At present, with the concept of farm-to-fork gaining increasing popularity, food safety and quality certification are of critical concern. Blockchain technology provides the traceability of food supply from the source, i.e., the seeding factories, to the customer’s table. The main idea of this paper is to identify blockchain technology with the Internet of things (IoT) devices to investigate the food conditions and various issues faced by transporters while supplying fresh food. Blockchain provides applications such as smart contracts to monitor, observe, and manage all transactions and communications among stakeholders. IoT technology provides approaches for verifying all transactions; these transactions are recorded and then stored in a centralized database system. Thus, IoT enables a safe and cost-effective FSCM system for stakeholders. In this paper, we contribute to the awareness of blockchain applications that are relevant to the food supply chain (FSC), and we present an analysis of the literature on relevant blockchain applications which has been conducted concerning various parameters. The observations in the present survey are also relevant to the application of blockchain technology with IoT in other areas. © 2022 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Recycling of electronic waste is a rapidly growing global issue that requires proper monitoring and tracing of electronic devices and the business transactions between the stakeholders. The majority of current systems that manage electronic devices throughout their supply chain stages are centralized and lack data transparency, immutability, and security. Specifically, such systems are incapable of handling problems like comprehensive coverage of the life cycle of e-products, access control for maintaining data security, reputation-aware selection of stakeholders, and large amounts of data generated during various stages of the supply chain processes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based IoT-enabled system for monitoring all post-production business processes, activities, and operations performed on an electronic device. The system is supported by five smart contracts that record the actions of users on the immutable distributed ledger that aid in ensuring that the business processes carried out by the participants are transparent, traceable, and secure. To store large files, such as images of e-waste materials, products, and licenses for stakeholders, we have integrated our system with a distributed storage system. The proposed system is tested on Ethereum blockchain to check the gas consumption of the functions of the smart contracts. The cost and security analysis shows that the proposed system is viable.},

 abstract = {Food security necessitates a multifaceted strategy, ranging from social protection to providing healthy food. Change in existing food systems is needed to create a more equitable and sustainable society. Hunger is one of the significant challenges in the world that arise due to food insecurity, bad quality, food waste, and losses that leads to damage of public health. The implementation of green food supply chain management (GFSCM) practices in the food supply chain helps in lowering food wastage, carbon emissions, food quality, and safety. To strengthen food security/safety and quality, digital transformation of the supply chain is required, and IoT and blockchain can help in achieving this. Digital transformation of GFSCM has helped to improve food security, safety and quality control. This study identifies modern enablers of food security, safety and quality that transform the GFSCM through Internet of things (IoT) and blockchain to reduce hunger. Zero hunger goal is far behind in India as India reported 117th rank in hunger index, indicating an urgent need to study the digital transformation in green food supply chain towards achieving food quality and security. In this study twelve enablers out of 16 suggested in earlier literatures has been selected and reconfirmed with the feedback of seventeen academia and Industrial experts from Indian food supply chain. We used a two-step combined Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) technique to examine the enablers contextual interrelationships and significance weights. Findings reveal that IoT and blockchain technologies are the main actuators of the contemporary GFSCM enabling system. ISM provides eight core enablers system that can transform the GFSCM digitally to achieve food quality and security along with achieving zero hunger (SDG2). Inventory management is the least ranked enabler, whereas IoT and blockchain are the top two. Towards achieving zero hunger, some management, theoretical, and policy implications have been suggested.},

 abstract = {Blockchain (BLC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two emerging technologies that have become popular among practitioners for improving the transparency, adaptability, and safety of any industry. This is especially critical for food security, as COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerability of food supply chain (FSC). However, Indian organizations are experiencing problems in implementing the integrated form of BLC-IoT due to limited knowledge and insufficient research. The current study aims to propose a conceptual framework to reduce the impact of adoption barriers against BLC-IoT in FSC. Thirteen key barriers were identified after a thorough literature review and consultation with experts. The relationship among barriers was established using Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMA℡) methods. The analysis shows that the lack of government regulation and workers' low competency significantly influence BLC-IoT adoption. The results also indicate the intricacy of decision-making by demonstrating that 9 of the 13 barriers were a part of the linkage cluster. The study outcome will help practitioners in developing and planning strategies for effective adoption of BLC-IoT in FSC.},

@article{li_blockchain-enabled_2022,
 abstract = {Configuring a trustworthy Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled building information modeling (BIM) platform (IBP) is significant for modular construction to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability throughout its fragmented supply chain management. However, most current IBPs are designed adopting a centralized system architecture, which fails to achieve a decentralized and effective one to ensure a single point of truth in BIM and prevent a single point of failure in IoT networks. To address this challenge, this study introduces permissioned blockchain with IBP and proposes a novel service-oriented system architecture of blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM platform (BIBP) for the data-information-knowledge (DIK)-driven supply chain management in modular construction. First, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is designed with hardware, core technologies, and protocols to offer accurate data from daily practice to blockchain BIM. Blockchain BIM as a service (BaaS) is then developed within the permissioned blockchain to ease the interoperability of the information, semantics, and meaningful inferences. Furthermore, software as a service (SaaS) is configured with decentralized applications to achieve knowledgeable operations or processes with a crash fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. The demonstrative case study in a modular student residence project evaluates the proposed BIBP system prototype with the performance analysis of storage cost, throughput, latency, privacy, and feedback from stakeholders. The results indicate that BIBP has an effective system architecture with acceptable throughput and latency, can save storage costs to achieve a single point of truth in BIM, and avoid a single point of failure for IoT networks with privacy and security-preserving mechanisms. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

 abstract = {In global Supply Chain Quality Management (SCQM), there are methods to ensure continuity of supply, at appropriate prices while meeting quality standards. But they are limited by the large and fallible role of humans, especially in manufacturing and quality control. Open Manufacturing aims to establish an open network of manufacturers that enables product information sharing among others in the production chain. Realizing the goals of open manufacturing requires processing the large datasets inherent to the production chain partners. But it is difficult to comply with the trust and privacy requirements of the suppliers in a supply chain. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of blockchain and its current and potential use in the industrial context including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based sensor networks, and the impact of the blockchain technology in manufacturing related areas such as traceability. The focus of this paper is on a potential application of blockchain in SCQM with detailed analysis of its technical feasibility and the methods of transitioning between the current approaches to a blockchain-oriented platform. An innovative use of blockchain to store referral information is also discussed. The survey concludes that blockchain along with IIoT can improve SCQM in an Open Manufacturing model. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

 abstract = {Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of today's world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product life-cycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a continuous delivery/continuous verifiability (CD/CV) method for IoT dataflows in edge–fog–cloud. A CD model based on extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) mechanism as well as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction, enable end-users to create efficient schemes for the continuous verification and validation of the execution of applications in edge–fog–cloud infrastructures. This scheme also verifies and validates established execution sequences and the integrity of digital assets. CV model converts ETL and DAG into business model, smart contracts in a private blockchain for the automatic and transparent registration of transactions performed by each application in workflows/pipelines created by CD model without altering applications nor edge–fog–cloud workflows. This model ensures that IoT dataflows delivers verifiable information for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes with certainty. A containerized parallelism model solves portability issues and reduces/compensates the overhead produced by CD/CV operations. We developed and implemented a prototype to create CD/CV schemes, which were evaluated in a case study where user mobility information is used to identify interest points, patterns, and maps. The experimental evaluation revealed the efficiency of CD/CV to register the transactions performed in IoT dataflows through edge–fog–cloud in a private blockchain network in comparison with state-of-art solutions.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly over the last decade as an emerging technology, offering various Internet-enabled devices to communicate in different contexts. With an ever-increasing time frame of the digital world, traceability and authentication have gained enormous significance. In general, a trusted third party is used to authenticate users, devices, or services in an IoT environment. However, in such situations, this centralized third party will become the focus of cyberattacks might not be the best solution. In this paper, a new authentication algorithm has been proposed to prevent malicious IoT devices. We address the traceability and authentication issues in IoT devices. This paper presents the concept of a blockchain that integrates Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to solve security issues, malicious activities, latency, and energy consumption challenges. The results show that the proposed solution outperforms existing solutions with less computational overhead. Similarly, the possibility of an attack is decreased compared to the current system. Throughput is enhanced by 20\% over the present system, while latency is decreased by 25\% over the previous technique. As a consequence, the likelihood of an attack is decreased by 30\% compared to the existing technique.},

 abstract = {Nowadays blockchain technology plays a vital role in creative developments and important discoveries in the world. Blockchain develops secure and trustworthy platforms for data sharing in various application areas such as secure sharing of medical data, Anti-money laundering, tracking systems, Supply chain, and logistics monitoring, Crypto-currency exchange, etc. Today’s Supply chain in the healthcare sector faces many problems like security, transparency, tampering with medical products, counterfeit drugs, more paperwork, high cost, and more time-consuming process while transporting medical equipment from manufacture to end-users. To overcome these problems, we introduce Novel Approach for Integrated IoT (Internet of Things) With Blockchain in Health Supply Chain (NAIBHSC) approach. By using this approach, we can eliminate all supply chain-related issues between suppliers and end-users. The goal of this research is by combining Blockchain technology with IoT to develop a smart health supply chain management system. This approach provides security, privacy, trust, visibility, decentralized tracking and tracing of the medical product, avoids counterfeit drugs, avoids the damage to medical components, authentication, reduces the cost, and provides the status of the products during the shipment process between manufacturers to end-user. In this approach, we conduct a series of experiments on a different group of users. The experimental results show that compare to existing approaches our proposed NAIBHSC approach gives better response time that is the average Transaction Per Second (TPS) for a group of 500 users is 100 milliseconds, reduces the latency time that is average latency time for 500 users group has 403 milliseconds, and improves the overall performance of the smart health supply chain management system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {There is a wide recognition that Blockchain technology will play a central role in many sectors. In fact, this technology is a promising opportunity to ensure security, traceability, privacy and transparency in most digitized human activities. The supply chain of hazardous materials is a typical sensitive industrial activity that requires a high level of vigilance. The various stakeholders of such supply chain need to share crucial data using high secure channels while ensuring traceability. However, Blockchain is currently an energy-intensive technology. In this context, the challenge is to minimize the risk related to the hazardous materials supply chain using an eco-friendly and cost effective Blockchain. In this paper, we propose a green-Blockchain based framework for the hazardous materials supply chain. Two mathematical models are proposed for the energy management consumed by Blockchain transactions. The first one minimizes the total consumed energy by a set of servers by providing the optimal assignment of computing tasks over the time periods, while the second one minimizes both the CO2 emissions and the cost of a grid energy mix. To prove the applicability of the proposed framework, a Blockchain prototype is implemented to simulate an IoT-based supply chain of hazardous materials. The results show that the proposed system may help to ensure the security of dangerous goods transportation. Furthermore, the energy management using optimization modeling would provide CO2 emissions reduction and thus ensure sustainability of Blockchain transactions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Blockchain is an egressing digitally managed technology which allows ubiquitous monetary transactions with the untrusted entities, without involving the intermediary bodies, viz., banks. The literature reveals that IoT along with blockchain technology (BT) offers various benefits to the functioning of the agriculture supply chain (AgriChain). It is going to be implemented with which BT is going to perform a change in paradigm in which the transactions will be taken care of by reducing the number of intermediaries, making fast payment procedures among the parties. Developing economies with an ever-growing population country like India caters to food security demands and faces lots of challenges pretending agriculture supply chain sustainability. Therefore, it is crucial to follow BT in the agriculture supply chain to leverage multiple profits. In this chapter, we develop a queueing model which evaluates in detail the characteristics of an AgriChain system and measures the performance of the model such as the number of transactions expected that are waiting inside the queue to enter into the block, mean transactions waiting in the block, waiting for the time of a transaction, confirmation time of any transaction, etc. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

@article{pincheira_characterization_2022,
 abstract = {An increasing amount of research focuses on integrating the Internet of Things and blockchain technology to address the requirements of traceability applications for Industry 4.0. However, there has been little quantitative analysis of several aspects of these new blockchain-based traceability systems. For instance, very few works have studied blockchain’s impact on the resources of constrained IoT sensors. Similarly, the infrastructure costs of these blockchain-based systems are not widely understood. This paper characterizes the resources of low-cost IoT sensors and provides a monetary cost model for blockchain infrastructure to support blockchain-based traceability systems. First, we describe and implement a farm-to-fork case study using public and private blockchain networks. Then, we analyze the impact of blockchain in six different resource-limited IoT devices in terms of disk and memory footprint, processing time, and energy consumption. Next, we present an infrastructure cost model and use it to identify the costs for the public and private networks. Finally, we evaluate the traceability of a product in different scenarios. Our results showed that low-cost sensors could directly interact with both types of blockchains with minimal energy overhead. Furthermore, our cost model showed that setting a private blockchain infrastructure costs approximately the same as that managing 50 products on a public blockchain network. © 2022 by the authors.

@article{powell_garbage_2022,
 abstract = {The application of blockchain in food supply chains does not resolve conventional IoT data quality issues. Data on a blockchain may simply be immutable garbage. In response, this paper reports our observations and learnings from an ongoing beef supply chain project that integrates Blockchain and IoT for supply chain event tracking and beef provenance assurance and proposes two solutions for data integrity and trust in the Blockchain and IoT-enabled food supply chain. Rather than aiming for absolute truth, we explain how applying the notion of ‘common knowledge’ fundamentally changes oracle identity and data validity practices. Based on the learnings derived from leading an IoT supply chain project with a focus on beef exports from Australia to China, our findings unshackle IoT and Blockchain from being used merely to collect lag indicators of past states and liberate their potential as lead indicators of desired future states. This contributes: (a) to limit the possibility of capricious claims on IoT data performance, and; (b) to utilise mechanism design as an approach by which supply chain behaviours that increase the probability of desired future states being realised can be encouraged. © 2021},

@article{prajapati_blockchain_2022,
 abstract = {Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) have accelerated e-commerce growth and empowered online businesses to create value even in a globally competitive environment. The goal of this study is to develop a framework for the virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) that is based on novel blockchain and IoT technologies, as well as the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used. The obtained results and performed sensitivity analysis are used to make some implications for business organisations and government administrators to create some important policies in favour of the environment, end-users, and the development of the organisation along with the nation.},

@article{rani_secured_2021,
 abstract = {The conventional method of implementing supply chain management suffers several limitations like cost, unpredictability, complicated environment, and wide-open access to sensitive information. To defeat these issues, the supply chains should be progressively more intelligent. To build a large-scale smart infrastructure of physical objects, products, and all the other supply chain-related processes, supply chain management can be integrated with the Internet of things (IoT). Open interrelation communication opens several threats in the supply chain environment. In the proposed work, we construct a supply chain network (SCN) secured with blockchain to find the optimum route of a product from a manufacturer to customer and to trace back a product to its origin. A genetic algorithm-based scheme is used to find the optimum route for a product and approach to trace back the origin of a product is proposed, which is especially beneficial in cases like a product turning out to be infected and the need to track the rest of the products of that batch. Simulation results are compared using two different consensuses for verification of transactions: PoW and proof of elapsed time. Graphical results show that proof of elapsed time outperforms PoW in terms of cost, processing power, and transaction verify per second. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

@article{rejeb_leveraging_2019,
 abstract = {Modern supply chains have evolved into highly complex value networks and turned into a vital source of competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects. © 2019 by the authors.},

@inproceedings{rupasena_scalable_2021,
 abstract = {Blockchain is an innovative technology which enabled new applications for solving numerous problems in distributed environments such as the internet of things (IoT) equipped food supply chains (FSCs). In FSCs, the large volume of IoT data such as audio, video, images, and sensor data will be transferred to ensure the traceability of the food to its source. When blockchain technology is used in an FSC, the storage requirements in the nodes will grow with time, since blockchain only allows information adding, without deleting the already stored information. Therefore, it is evident that offchain storage offers more flexibility than onchain storage in IoT equipped supply chains. This paper proposes a scalable storage scheme using offchain storage, where the data from IoT devices in the supply chain will store offchain. To reduce the growth of offchain storage, we exploit the fact that some information regarding a particular food item may not be required after the expiration date. The scalability of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical and experimental results.},

 abstract = {In industrial sectors, the supply chain management (SCM) systems have been getting smarter by accepting and deploying of evolutionarily advanced technologies, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT made a supply chain more efficient than ever before; IoT analytical tools enable the organizations to manage and react to all important issues and events of the supply chain in well and decent ways. However, the increasingly high demands and complex structure of supply chain systems, including the growing number of participants and operations, are the main concerns to managing the business effectiveness. IoT is a solution to this problem. IoT uses its smart technologies to manage and trigger the supply chain events and operations, and therefore enables an effective supply chain delivery; however, to keep privacy and security in complex, a scaled structure of the supply chain is a challenge for IoT centralized platform. This paper indents to deploy a proof of concept, end-to-end supply chain management (E2ESCM) system for asset delivery (i.e., food products), employing the combined features of IoT and Blockchain. With IoT-Blockchain, we can surely develop and later examine the end-to-end product delivery; IoT devices are used to get instant information, and Blockchain is used to record every transaction occurs in supply ecosystem onto its secure ledger system; the record is always immutable, and participants participating into a distributed network are authorized to maintain record onto a ledger. Therefore, employing IoT-Blockchain, the study examines a significant level of security, traceability, and transparency among participants within the supply chain ecosystem. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {The present study looks at how the internet of things and blockchain technology might be used to improve prospects in supply chain procedures. The current pandemic has highlighted the significance of resilient and dependable supply chain systems that are less dependent on humans and more efficient in cycling goods supply chains. The present study included and excluded records from two recognised databases, Scopus and Web of Science, using the PRISMA declaration 2020. After following the inclusion and exclusion criteria details, investigated the forty-seven articles with two significant data streams (traceability of supply chain management, resin and sustainability). Results illustrated that in today's environment, the rivalry has shifted from "firm vs firm" to "supply chain vs supply chain." As a result, the ability to optimise the supply chain has arisen as a significant issue for organisations seeking a competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to traceability of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The Internet of Things (IoT) applications and blockchain technologies can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, privacy, security and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimise operations in warehousing, manufacturing, food supply chain and transportation. Combined with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable various application scenarios to enhance supply-chain transparency and trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. First, we illustrate how deploying Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we also identified that the resilience of big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence is helpful for the sustainable development of social, economic and environmental contexts © 2023, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.All Rights Reserved.},

As the technology is new, there is a lack of knowledge and experience in selecting suitable platforms for SC networks. Choosing the right platform is a difficult and complex task involving multiple and conflicting criteria. This study presents a novel practical approach for evaluating and selecting a BT-IoT platform in SC networks using multi-criteria decision-making. First, an extensive literature review is conducted to determine the most suitable criteria for BT-IoT platform selection. Then, using the interval Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System (WINGS) method, the weights of the criteria are calculated, and finally an interval VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique is used to assess the suitability of the platforms. The proposed approach uses the experts’ preferences, considers the interdependencies among criteria in the weighting process, and enables implementation in a hierarchical and interconnected network. We present a case study in the food industry to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. Additional sensitivity analysis is conducted to exhibit the efficacy of the proposed model in selecting a suitable and robust platform in SC networks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Rapid urbanization has recently caused serious problems for cities all around the world. Smart cities have drawn much interest from researchers in the present research paradigm to manage the expanding urban population. Frameworks for smart cities are planned and implemented using platforms based on blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIOT). Smart cities may use the BIoT platform to provide improved transportation, food traceability, and healthcare services. Food safety is one of the sectors where less research has been done than the others. The importance of food safety is now more widely recognized, making it essential to improve the traceability and transparency of the food supply chain. In this paper, a novel BIOT-based layered framework using EOSIO has been proposed for effective food traceability. The proposed system first identifies the suitable traceability units to provide better transparency and traceability and then defines and implements a layered architecture using Ethereum and EOSIO blockchain platforms. The performance of the proposed EOSIO-based model is evaluated using the practicality of the consensus algorithm, block production rate, throughput, and block confirmation time. The proposed traceability system attains a block production rate of 0.5 s and a block confirmation time of 1 s, which is much lower than the Ethereum-based traceability system. Hence, from the experimental evidence, the superiority of the proposed EOSIO-based food traceability can be observed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

@article{tsang_blockchain-driven_2019,
 abstract = {Food traceability has been one of the emerging blockchain applications in recent years, for improving the areas of anti-counterfeiting and quality assurance. Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation.},

@article{turki_nft-iot_2023,
 abstract = {The public's health depends on a reliable drug supply chain. Recently, the number of drug counterfeit has increased drastically, resulting in thousands of victims suffering from poisoning and/or treatment failures, which have resulted in new expectations on drug supply chain traceability. Indeed, the drug supply chain involves many parties having heterogeneous interests and are usually reluctant to share traceability data with each other. Furthermore, existing traceability and provenance systems for drug supply chains suffer from separated data storage, lack of information sharing transparency, and trust. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are advocated to address these limitations by realizing decentralized trustless systems. In this work, we present a fully decentralized, blockchain-based drug traceability solution, worthy of seamless integrating IoT devices throughout the chain. It uses both smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage to remove the need for middleman and to provide trusted, secure and immutable transaction history. Moreover, to preserve the traceability of drugs, it ensures and enforces data provenance and data integrity in the proposed IoT environment by using blockchain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We give a test and validation of the approach's effectiveness in enhancing drug traceability supply chains, as well as an analysis of the approach's costs and security. © 2022 The Author(s)},

 abstract = {This study aims to estimate the costs of integrating RFID and IoT with blockchain for supply chain management. The study is based on the comparison of two simulation scenarios in a cheese supply chain, the as-is case vs. the integration of the following technologies: blockchain, smart contracts, RFID and IoT. Using the Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method, costs are allocated for six actors: dairy farm, 3PL, wholesaler and three retailers. In addition, the costs of each player are allocated for each supply chain area: logistics, warehouse and order management. The study shows in which areas and for which actors implementing and integrating different technologies is economically suitable. Different procurement policies are modelled for evaluating the cost impacts for each retailer: Economic Order Quantity, Period Order Quantity and Lot for Lot. Moreover, the costs of non-compliant products are assessed in both scenarios. The results show that specific areas such as warehouse management and logistics in the to-be scenario are not economically optimized, however the entire supply chain cost is optimized. The area with positive economic feasibility for all the participants in the supply chain is order management. The combined use of technologies is economically beneficial when the Economic Order Quantity procurement policy is adopted. Finally, in the to-be scenario the non-compliant products management is economically optimized with economic benefits ranging from 8\% to 63\%.},

@article{wu_blockchain-based_2022,
 abstract = {A framework combining the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain can help achieve system automation and credibility, and the corresponding technologies have been applied in many industries, especially in the area of agricultural product traceability. In particular, IoT devices (radio frequency identification (RFID), geographic information system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), etc.) can automate the collection of information pertaining to the key aspects of traceability. The data are collected and input to the blockchain system for processing, storage, and query. A distributed, decentralized, and nontamperable blockchain can ensure the security of the data entering the system. However, IoT devices may generate abnormal data in the process of data collection. In this context, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the source data of the traceability system. Considering the whole-process traceability chain of agricultural products, this paper analyzes the whole-process information of a tea supply chain from planting to sales, constructs the system architecture and each function, and designs and implements a machine learning- (ML-) blockchain-IoT-based tea credible traceability system (MBITTS). Based on IoT technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors, this article proposes a new method that combines blockchain and ML to enhance the accuracy of blockchain source data. In addition, system data storage and indexing methods and scanning and recovery mechanisms are proposed. Compared with the existing agricultural product (tea) traceability system based on blockchain, the introduction of the ML data verification mechanism can ensure the accuracy (up to 99\%) of information on the chain. The proposed solution provides a basis to ensure the safety, reliability, and efficiency of agricultural traceability systems. © 2022 Yuting Wu et al.},

@article{yan_study_2022,
 abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) expanded rapidly, resulting in many services, software products, and electrical devices integrated with sensors. It is associated with protocols that are currently under development. Blockchain technology serves as the foundation for most IoT-based applications, and it must be adaptable and widely disseminated to guarantee their survival. Blockchain-based IoT has several limitations due to its resource-constrained nature, including security, scalability, traceability, efficiency, and network throughput. The suggested method in this paper is a Privacy-assisted Information Exchange Framework (P-IEF), an integrated security mechanism that detects suspicious activities in sensor nodes and locates them on a blacklist. This approach is a centered digital ledger procedure that ensures the privacy of all nodes and ensures that the data can be validated without modifying any node, and there is no need for a third party to secure data. The simulation analysis shows trust measures and open challenges, and research difficulties examined in IoT environments. The privacy-assisted information exchange framework has achieved a security ratio of 98.25 \%, a scalability ratio of 97.15 \%, traceability rate of 98.54\%, efficiency rate of 99.01 \%, and network throughput ratio of 97.19 \% outperforms compared with other approaches. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

 abstract = {With the continuous progress of blockchain technology, how to use it for commodity traceability has become a concern. This study mainly discusses the Internet of Things supervision system and supply chain financial supervision method based on blockchain technology. The whole blockchain network is a decentralized system, which consists of six layers: data layer, network layer, and consensus layer. These three layers are the foundation layer; the other three layers are incentive layer, contract layer, and application layer. The interface of the platform needs to be conceived in combination with the business of building materials. According to the functional differentiation, the required interfaces mainly include information generation interface, information verification, information retrieval, and other information interfaces. Smart contracts can process data, operate asset transactions, manage smart assets, and expand the ability of blockchain to use data. In this way, the blockchain technology can trace the source of the data, so as to ensure the authenticity and security of the data. Blockchain technology can be used in data tracking. Specifically, in the building materials industry, with the help of blockchain technology, building material mixing enterprises can see the raw materials such as sand and gravel purchased under the order, the region where they are produced, the time point of transportation, the carrier, etc. In the process of supply chain financial supervision experiment, when the pledge rate of building materials is within the range of [0.4206,1], the bank income under the block chain mode is higher. The system designed in this study realizes the certification and traceability of building materials and has good use value. © 2021 Jun Zhang.},
